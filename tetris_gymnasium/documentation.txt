pip install tetris-gymnasium

introduce things step by step (editing can be done in venv\Lib\site-packages\tetris_gymnasium\envs\tetris.py)
change reward system if you want to (venv\Lib\site-packages\tetris_gymnasium\mappings\rewards.py)

first introduce 2x2 block and only right left movement in 4 width 20 height
introduce other blocks and rotations (remove reward of left/right movement) 

reward system: clearing lines, surviving as long as possible

naming convention:
CONT: continuation on a previous trained model
XxX: height x width area
LR: left right movement
BAD_xxxxx_x: bad choice, reason, run (see run number for more info)
O: O tetronimo
I: I tetronimo
T: T tetronimo
S: S tetronimo
Z: Z tetronimo
J: J tetronimo
L: L tetronimo



trained_models:
not random seed
1. left and right movement only 2x2 block (tetronimo) in 4x20 area (10000 timesteps) good test, first placement is weird but it works fine

2. left and right movement only 2x2 block (tetronimo) in 10x20 area (10000 timesteps), fills lines sometimes stacks tetronimoes often. (total reward: 37.199999999999974)
3. continuation 2. (100 000 timesteps) doesn't work at all, stacks tetronimoes, irregular (total reward: -1.3)
4. continuation 2. (100 000 timesteps) changed exploration rate (0.1), even worse (total reward: -2.3000000000000007)
5. continuation 4. (1 000 000 timesteps) changed learning rate to change over time, still bad 
6. continuation 5. (1 000 000 timesteps) idem 

7. changed reward for clearing line to 100, others to either -1 or 1, if the model moves while already at the edge -> -1, changed exploration rate (0.4) and train freq changed (1->4)(n_updates) continuation on 2. (100000 timesteps)
    -> dumb decision, model doesn't touch the border anymore -> can't clear lines
8. removed dumb rule (100 000 timesteps)(total reward: 280) -> still hasn't cleared any lines yet
9. continuation 8.: i think the model just requires more training? (500 000 timesteps) (total reward: 273)
10. added reward to game over -> -100, new training with all blocks and all actions, not good
11. continuation 10. (1 000 000 timesteps)



potential extension -> add more tetronimoes/play with area/
